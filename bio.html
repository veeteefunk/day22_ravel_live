        <p>Maurice Ravel (7 March 1875 / 28 December 1937) was a French
             composer, pianist and conductor. He is often associated with Impressionism
              along with his elder contemporary Claude Debussy, although both composers
               rejected the term. In the 1920s and 1930s Ravel was internationally 
               regarded as France's greatest living composer.
